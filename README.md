Analysis of Genotype Data Available from the 1000 Genomes Project


Task Description

1. Use genotype data that is available in the 1000 Genomes project.

2. Use various statistical analysis tools of your choice as covered by the end this course: linear regression model; classification methods such as logistic regression, classification trees, random forests; variable selection methods such as LASSO-type selection and using decision trees-based pruning; PCA and clustering analysis: hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering. You are welcome to combine other methods not covered in this course with the ones you choose to apply form the list above.

3. Make up your own objective of the study by exploring the IGSR website. Examples of objective include:

i)	Cluster a sample of individuals according to their genetic information.
ii)	Perform gene-based association analysis with some traits of interest such as Skin color, ethnicities, etc.
iii)	Classify individuals to different ethnic group according to their genetic information.

Page limit: 5 pages, including title, names, abstract, main text, references. Figures and tables that you choose to use should appear in a natural flow in the main text.

Some Practical Hints:

a) Remove SNPs that are really rare across populations: <0.001.
b) You can back check those equilibriums covered in the course: HWE, LD structure, etc, in your data analysis.
c) Quality is more important than quantity.
d) Please limit the number of SNPs in your analysis; donâ€™t do the whole genome/genome-wide analysis. You may focus on a few genes/regions.

The grading of your group project will be according to the following grading scheme, where each area is worth 5 marks that make up a total of 40 marks.

1. Background and objective
2. Details and description of data
3. Detail of data analysis methods
4. Summary of results
5. Conclusions and discussions
6. Citations (appropriateness) and bibliography (accuracy and format of the reference)
7. Appendix of R-code
8. Quality of the presentation (grammar, spelling, and coherence)
